## Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro) to install and manage node.js 

#### If you do not already have node.js installed on your machine, it is recommended to do so using the node version manager: 

1> Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) using **one** of these commands:

cURL: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`

Wget: `wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`

2> Install latest node.js LTS version

`nvm install 16`

3> Check that node is available from the command line.

`node -v`

### You're done!
